## Learning objectives

-   Understand selection surfaces

-   Understand how populations can respond to selection

-   Communicate how selective surfaces matter

-   Verbally describe breeder's equation

-   Connect evolution and ecology

## Contour maps

## Optimality surface

## Breeder's equation

$$
âˆ†X = \mu_{i+1}-\mu_i = h^2S
$$

-   What is $h$?

-   What is $S$?

-   How does each matter?

-   Is $h$ constant through time?

-   Is $S$ constant through time?

## Chasing peaks

## Supply and demand

Supplied, hoping there would be demand

Demand, hoping there will be a supply of tools to do this

## Supply and demand

How does evolution work for this?

-   What's the supply?

-   What's the demand?

-   Does supply arise to fit demand?

-   Does supply affect demand?

## Cheaters never prosper?

"If the harshness of the environment increases, the predicted response depends on seed dispersal: if dispersal distances are short, plants are selected to increase their investment in traits that maintain local facilitation; if long, the profitability of maintaining recolonizable neighbouring sites drops and **'cheater'** types can exploit the system until its collapse, leading to a desert void of plants even though evolution of stronger facilitation would have allowed a population to deal with the new level of aridity"

## Questions

-   How do past bottlenecks affect selection potential?

-   Is niche modification eco-evolutionary feedback?

-   How might selection affect speciation?

-   Does evolution have foresight?

-   Why do large populations accumulate more neutral genetic variation and small populations accumulate more deleterious mutations?

-   What is bet-hedging?

-   Cryptic genetic variation. What?
